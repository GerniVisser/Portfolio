## üó∫Ô∏èRoadmap

The goal of this project is to use this microservice architecture 
to enable the easy deployment of any future web-based projects I 
choose to create. This platform would then be used to host these 
projects in an interactive manner in order to showcase the work I 
have done.

- Host a interactive app on the platform 
- Generate analytic reports
- Expand ecosytem to run on kubernetties to adjust to user trafic
